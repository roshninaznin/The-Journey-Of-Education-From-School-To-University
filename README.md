## Overviewn
The Journey of Education is an interactive OpenGL + GLUT simulation that visually represents a student's academic journey from school to university.

The project includes:

- Five dynamic scenes (School, College, University, Classroom, Transition)
- User-controlled buses (Yellow & Blue) for student transportation 🚍
- Gradient color effects 🎨
- Background music & sound effects 🎵
- Keyboard & Mouse interactions for smooth control

The simulation follows a structured flow where students travel via buses, attend class, and finally graduate 🎓.
