![Total Scene](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6710822-c4a7-4461-8aa4-7fb4ca9db0c6)



## Overview
The Journey of Education is an interactive OpenGL + GLUT simulation that visually represents a student's academic journey from school to university.

The project includes:

- Five dynamic scenes (School, College, University, Classroom, Transition)
- User-controlled buses (Yellow & Blue) for student transportation 🚍
- Gradient color effects
- Background music & sound effects 
- Keyboard & Mouse interactions for smooth control

The simulation follows a structured flow where students travel via buses, attend class, and finally graduate 🎓.

## Installation

1. Installation & Running the Project
  -  Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/roshninaznin/The-Journey-Of-Education-From-School-To-University
```
2. Then navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd The-Journey-Of-Education-From-School-To-University
```

3. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
  - CodeBlocks (or any C++ IDE with OpenGL support)
  - OpenGL & GLUT (for rendering graphics)
    
4. Setting Up CodeBlocks for OpenGL
   - Open CodeBlocks and go to Settings → Compiler
   - Under the Linker Settings tab, add the following libraries:
```bash
-lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32
```
Ensure your GLUT header files are included in your project directory.

5. Adding Music Files 
     - Go to your project's bin/Debug folder.
     - Paste the .wav music file in the folder.
This ensures the music plays correctly when you run the project.

6.  Running the Project
    - Open the project in CodeBlocks.
    - Click on Build and Run (or press F9).
Enjoy the educational journey from school to university! 🎓🚍🎶
